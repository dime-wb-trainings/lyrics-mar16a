Now I'm not knockin' country
And I'm not rappin' rap
Big band swing just ain't my thing
Alternative ain't my snap

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

Music makes you happy
Or it can make you sad
It can turn the worst day
To the best you ever had
For entertainment value
If I had to choose
You and me might disagree
'Cause I like rhythm and blues

Now I'm not dissin' disco
Not sayin' punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal
'Cause I gotta have that funk
